All the non-original modules should be installed here to preserve
bot integrity. This folder will also be where the package_manager
will install the extra modules. Like this, the userbot will have
a fully working update system.

Any of the extra modules should be updated by the user, either with
a reinstall or an update, using the .pkg command and the right args.
