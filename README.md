## What is this?
HyperUBot is a modular telegram userbot. It does not require any form of Database. It has support to be fully translatable, contains it's own package manager, with an official repo and the possibility to configure multiple extra community repos. It contains also a sideloader for .py files sent in chat. The aim of this userbot is to become an extension of it's own user. Instead of coming cluttered with all kinds of packages, it is fully customizable, aiming to be fast.

## How to configure it
In the main repo there are files named GUIDE_PLATFORM.md, where PLATFORM is either Windows, MacOS, DebianBasedLinux and Termux. Following these guides should be enough to get you started! 

Currently, Heroku is not supported! Maybe it will, maybe not. There are still some loose ends with the way the package manager handles packages, and how Heroku works.

If you have the means, I recommend Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04. As it's setup is a lot easier. Follow the instructions in GUIDE_DebianBasedLinux.md for such!
