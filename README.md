## What is this?

HyperUBot is a modular telegram userbot. It does not require any form of Database. It has support to be fully translatable, contains it's own package manager, with an official repo and the possibility to configure multiple extra community repos. It contains also a sideloader for .py files sent in chat. The aim of this userbot is to become an extension of it's own user. Instead of coming cluttered with all kinds of packages, it is fully customizable, aiming to be fast.

## Compatibility

HyperUBot works with Windows, MacOS, Linux and Termux (although it's kinda the same as Linux). Right now, Heroku is not supported!

I recommend using Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04. As it's setup is a lot easier.

## How to configure it

 - [Debian Based Distros](https://github.com/nunopenim/HyperUBot/blob/master/GUIDES/SETUP_DebianBasedLinux.md)
 - [Termux](https://github.com/nunopenim/HyperUBot/blob/master/GUIDES/SETUP_Termux.md)
