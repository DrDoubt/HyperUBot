# HyperUBot Guide - Set up in unsupported platforms

If you are reading this, probably you use an unconventional Operating System or Platform. Well, we will still try to help you, but offer no promise that it will work or will keep working in case we update it.

You must install the packages ``python3 git ffmpeg flac``, using your package manager. That you know better than us how to use. If not, uncle Google is your friend. Your platform also needs a way to perform pings via shell. In Debian based Linux distros, this is in a package named ``net-tools``.

It is also recommended, but not a requirement, to have the ``neofetch`` package installed.

In these platforms, we cannot help you much, as we lack knowledge.

## Full package list:

``python3 git ffmpeg flac neofetch`` 

Package that contains ping.
